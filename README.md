# 42 Piscine – All Exercises

This repository contains all the exercises I completed during the **42 Piscine**, an intensive C programming bootcamp designed to challenge problem-solving skills and promote collaborative learning.

## 🧭 About the 42 Piscine
The 42 Piscine is a four-week immersion where participants:
- Learn the C language from scratch.
- Practice algorithms, memory management, and debugging.
- Work in a peer-to-peer environment without teachers, relying on self-learning and teamwork.

It’s a unique experience that tests persistence, creativity, and the ability to learn independently.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder corresponds to a project or exercise set from the curriculum:

├── C00
├── C01
├── C02
├── C03
├── C04
├── Rush00
├── Rush01
├── Rush02
└── Shell00


> Every directory includes the source files and, when needed, its own README or instructions.

## 🛠️ Skills Practiced
- **C Programming**: pointers, memory allocation, functions, and more.
- **Unix Shell**: commands, scripting, and file manipulation.
- **Algorithms & Problem-Solving**: from basic logic to more complex challenges.
- **Git & Version Control**: managing and organizing code efficiently.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mbjabalquinto/Piscine-42.git
2. Enter any project folder and follow the compilation/run instructions inside.

🏆 Personal Note

Completing the 42 Piscine was an intense and rewarding journey.
It taught me not only C programming, but also how to learn how to learn, work under pressure, and collaborate with peers.
